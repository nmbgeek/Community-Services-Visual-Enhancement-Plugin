# HMIS Visual Enhancement plugin

This is the code used in the HMIS Visual Enhancement plugin which will hopefully be in the Google Extension store very soon. It is intended to add contrast to some hard to read items and add clarity to sections.  You may also download the contents here, enable Chrome Developer mode, and load as an "unpacked" extension.
